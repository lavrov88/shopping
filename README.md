# Efficient shopping list
Shopping app with easy access to all lists and ability to quickly create several items.
This little project is written on vanilla JS, without any frameworks and pre-processors.
The main design idea was inpired by [Super simple shopping list](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitwize10.supersimpleshoppinglist) Android app.

## Main features:
- All lists together are placed on a screen, goods can be turned to bought by one click
- You can add several new goods at one moment. Just write them in add-goods menu, separating with commas.
- Bought goods move to the end of a list (with 2 sec delay for more convenient multi-element control). - You can delete them from separated list or from all lists using menu button.
- Goods can be sorted, renamed or deleted in list options
- Lists also can be sorted, renamed, added, deleted. Their color can be changed.
- Mobile layout, dark theme and saving data in local storage are included
